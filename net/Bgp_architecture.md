-  Enable communication between containers on different hosts natively using vlan encap 
-  Enables communication between containers and non containers 
-  Provides capability for uplink TOR's/Leaf switches to learn containers deployed in the fabric

#What are the recommended topologies ?

#Typical worklow:
- Configure Bgp on the Leaf switches Leaf 1 and Leaf 2 
- Bring up Contiv â€“ netplugin and netmaster
- Create a Vlan network with subnet pool and gateway
- Add Bgp configuration on the host, to peer with the uplink leaf
- Bring up containers in the networks created on the host

#What are the supported configurations

- Ensure that BGP peering between the host server and the leaf switch is eBGP
- Currently only one uplink from the server is supported
- Currently supported on bare-metals (watch this space for support on VMs soon)

#Supported version
